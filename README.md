# Aiobmsble
Requires Python 3 and uses [asyncio](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html) and [Bleak](https://pypi.org/project/bleak/)

## Asynchronous Library to Query Battery Management Systems via Bluetooth LE
This library is intended to query data from battery management systems that use Bluetooth LE. Stand-alone usage is possible in any Python environment (with necessary dependencies installed). It is developed to support [BMS_BLE-HA integration](https://github.com/patman15/BMS_BLE-HA/) that was written to make BMS data available to Home Assistant, but can be hopefully useful for other use-cases as well.

## Features
- Support for autodetecting compatible BLE BMSs
- Automatic detection of compatible BLE write mode
- Asynchronous operation using [asyncio](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html)
- Any number of batteries in parallel
- 100% test coverage plus fuzz tests for BLE data

> [!CAUTION]
> This library **shall not be used for safety relevant operations**! The correctness or availability of data cannot be guaranteed (see [warranty section of the license](LICENSE)),
> since the implementation is mostly based on openly available information or non-validated vendor specifications.
> Further, issues with the Bluetooth connection, e.g. disturbances, can lead to unavailable or incorrect values.
> 
> **Do not rely** on the values to control actions that prevent battery damage, overheating (fire), or similar.

### Supported Devices
The [list of supported devices](https://github.com/patman15/BMS_BLE-HA?tab=readme-ov-file#supported-devices) is maintained in the repository of the related [Home Assistant integration](https://github.com/patman15/BMS_BLE-HA).
For details about the supported data per BMS, please have a look at [BMS data table](https://github.com/patman15/aiobmsble/blob/main/docs/available_bms_data.csv):
- A `✓` means that the field is directly available from the BMS.
- A `.` means that the field is not natively available, but all required fields for its calculation are available.
- Empty means that the field is not available at all.

### [API documentation](https://patman15.github.io/aiobmsble/)
The project uses [pdoc](https://pdoc.dev/) to generate the [API documentation](https://patman15.github.io/aiobmsble/). You can generate it locally using the [installation for development](#for-development) and then running the command
```bash
pdoc 'aiobmsble' '!aiobmsble.bms' -o docs
```
which will generate the documentation locally in the `/docs` folder.


## Usage
In order to identify all devices that are reachable and supported by the library, simply run
```bash
aiobmsble
```
from the command line after [installation](#installation).

```bash
aiobmsble --json '{"local_name": "dummy"}'
```
returns the BMS type using the JSON advertisement data, e.g. from [Home Assistant Bluetooth Advertisement Monitor](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/bluetooth/#advertisement-monitor).

### From your Python code
In case you need a reference to include the code into your library, please see [\_\_main\_\_.py](/aiobmsble/__main__.py).

### From a Script
This example can also be found as an [example](/examples/minimal.py) in the respective [folder](/main/examples).

import asyncio
import logging
from typing import Final

from bleak import BleakScanner
from bleak.backends.device import BLEDevice
from bleak.exc import BleakError

from aiobmsble import BMSSample

        logger.error("Device '%s' not found.", dev_name)
        return

    logger.info("Found device: %s (%s)", device.name, device.address)

            logger.info("Updating BMS data...")
            data: BMSSample = await bms.async_update()

        logger.error("Failed to update BMS: %s", type(ex).__name__)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main(NAME))  # pragma: no cover
```

### Testing
For integration tests (using pytest) the library provides advertisement data that can be used to verify detection of BMSs. For your tests you can use

```python
from aiobmsble.test_data import bms_advertisements

def test_advertisements() -> None:
    """Run some tests with the advertisements"""
    for advertisement, bms_type, _comments in bms_advertisements():
        ...
```

## Installation
Install python and pip if you have not already, then run:
```bash
pip3 install pip --upgrade
pip3 install wheel
```

### For Production:

```bash
pip3 install aiobmsble
```
This will install the latest library release and all of it's python dependencies.

### For Development:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/patman15/aiobmsble.git
cd aiobmsble
pip3 install -e .[dev]
```
This gives you the latest library code from the main branch.

## Troubleshooting
In case you have problems with the library, please enable debug logging. You can also run `aiobmsble -v` from the command line in order to query all known BMS that are reachable.

### In case you have troubles you'd like to have help with 

- please record a debug log using `aiobmsble -v -l debug.log`,
- [open an issue](https://github.com/patman15/aiobmsble/issues/new?assignees=&labels=question&projects=&template=support.yml) with a good description of what your question/issue is and attach the log, or
- [open a bug](https://github.com/patman15/aiobmsble/issues/new?assignees=&labels=Bug&projects=&template=bug.yml) if you think the behaviour you see is misbehaviour of the library, including a good description of what happened, your expectations,
- and put the `debug.log` **as attachment** to the issue.
